## Do the Demos

If you are here to reproduce a demo in the comfort of your home/office, go in in the section [Sessions](#sessions). In each session you will find deployment instructions, to create the environment you need, and a tutorial to do the demo step by step.

## Presenting the content

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this repository will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions & code.

## Sessions

Here all the sessions available in the learning path **Migrating your Server Infrastructure** (aka: **MSI**)


### [MSI10: Migrating to Windows Server 2019](./msi10/README.md) 

Tailwind Traders has acquired Northwind, a large subsidiary company. Northwind currently has 1500 servers running Windows Server 2008 R2 - either directly or virtually - on hardware at the midpoint of its operational lifespan. While Tailwind Traders will eventually move many of these workloads to Azure, Windows Server 2008 R2 end of life is quickly approaching. In this session, learn how Tailwind Traders‚Äô used Azure hybrid management technologies to migrate servers, and the roles that they host, to Windows Server 2019.


### [MSI11: Top Five New Features of Windows Server 2019](./msi11/README.md) 

This 20 minute theatre session provides an overview of 5 (well that's what it says on the title, it's actually more) new features of Windows Server 2019.


### [MSI20: Hybrid Management Technologies](./msi20/README.md) 

Tailwind Traders has now migrated the majority of their server hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2019. Now, they are interested in the Azure hybrid technologies that are readily available to them. In this session, learn how Tailwind Traders began using Windows Admin Center to manage its fleet of Windows Server computers and integrated hybrid technologies, such as Azure File Sync, Azure Active Directory Password Protection, Azure Backup, and Windows Defender ATP, to improve deployment performance and manageability.


### [MSI30: Migrating IaaS Workloads to Azure](./msi30/README.md) 

Now that the migration of their server hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2019 is complete, Tailwind Traders wants to begin the process of ‚Äúlift and shift‚Äù: migrating some of their on-premises VMs they‚Äôve been running in their datacenter.  

In this session, learn about how Tailwind Traders began the process of migrating some of their existing VM workloads to Azure and how this allowed them to retire aging server hardware and close datacenter and server rooms that were costing the organization a substantial amount of money.
